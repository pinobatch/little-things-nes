Two of the four characters are nander, a race that is just over half
the height of humans with a somewhat shorter trunk and arms and more
noticeably short legs.  The other two are polis, who have no legs and
scoot on their hands and bottom.  Two of them are "girly", appearing
more feminine than the other two, who are "tomboys."
